# Worderoo
Worderoo is a clone of the popular word game that rhymes with hurdle and starts with the letter “W.” Worderoo lets you play as many times as you want (not restricted to once a day), use a different word length (3–6 letters long, not just 5 letters), browse your previous games, and configure other settings about the game.
